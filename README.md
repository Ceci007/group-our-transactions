## Tests with RSpec 

This website was tested with [Rspec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSpec) wich is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) testing tool written in programming language Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in production applications. 

## Install rspec-rails gem

- Once rspec install has finished, go to project directory and type ```rails generate rspec:install``` 
- You will see a folder ```spec``` and a files ```rails_helper.rb``` and ```spec_helper.rb``` created inside that folder.
